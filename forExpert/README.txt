Hello,

two folders are provided

1) Arduino contains two scripts to send data to matlab, either from 2 potentiometers or from the 4 EMG signals

2) Data contains all the data recorded, folded according to the different frequencies. There are also old data, if you want to test them

3) Matlab contains different scripts, divided into different folder, each one with a name that explains what are the scripts inside doing. Each script is commented, so no further explanation is given.

4) Unity contains all the scripts for the video game. Again, more information can be found in the folder
